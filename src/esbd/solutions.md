On a purely exact thermodynamic level, we can talk about having a solid compound such as $\mathrm{NaCl}$ in equilibrium with a solvent (such as water), where part of it dissolves and dissociates into $\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ ions, leading to

$$V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}= \frac{1}{F}\mu_{\mathrm{NaCl}} \approx -3.9813~\mathrm{V}.$$

This value of $V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$ is a thermodynamic guarantee for an $\mathrm{NaCl}$-saturated solution, at least for the standard conditions that gave us the value $\mu_{\mathrm{NaCl}} = -384.14~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ for salt. But its value will not change depending on solvent nor the presence of any other ions in solution.

But suppose we only dissolve a small amount of salt, then $V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$ will be a lower value than its saturated value. How _exactly_ does the $V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$ difference depend on concentration? And what if there are many ions present, then how much of each ion do we have and where do all their $V_i$'s lie in relation to each other?

For this topic, we'll focus primarily on the _ideally dilute_ case, and put off discussions of the (surprisingly tricky!) concept of ion activities until we get to the advanced topics.

## Ideally dilute and the standard species voltage $V^\ominus_i$

A familiar expression from chemistry is the dependence of a solute's chemical potential on its concentration $c$:
$$ \mu_i(c_i) \approx \mu^\ominus_i + RT \ln(c_i/c^\ominus) $$
This approximation only holds for small $c$ values, but it captures a behaviour known as _ideally dilute_. Here, $c^\ominus$ is a reference concentration level of 1 mol/L, and $\mu^\ominus_i$ is a reference value that extrapolates the value $\mu_i(c^\ominus)$ based off its behaviour in the infinite dilution limit. Chemists have done great work cataloguing $\mu^\ominus_i$ values for various solutes, in the form of molar Gibbs energies of formation for solutes (which, remember, we directly map to $\mu$!).

Well, let's try adapting that equation to ions. No problem, we just use the electrochemical potential:

$$ \bar\mu_i(c_i) \approx \bar\mu^\ominus_i + RT \ln(c_i/c^\ominus). $$

But, remember how $\bar\mu_i$ had the charge-dependent offset? Well, that must affect its reference value $\bar\mu^\ominus_i$ too. OK, well, let's just force that reference value into a species voltage too! Divide _all the things_ by $z_i F$!

$$ V_i(c_i) \approx V^\ominus_i + \frac{RT}{z_i F} \ln(c_i/c^\ominus). $$

The following is the operational definition of $V^\ominus_i$ by the way: make the above curve approach accuracy as we approach pure solvent. (i.e., as _all the solutes_' concentrations go to zero, including ion $i$.)

OK, so that is still kind of of like our familiar neutral solutes' $\mu_i(c_i)$ equation, except:
* Cations: Still $V_{\mathrm{X}^+}$ does grow higher relative to $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{X}^+}$ as concentration $c_i$ increases.
* Anions: Now $V_{\mathrm{Y}^-}$ _goes lower_ relative to $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{Y}^-}$ as concentration increases!
* Higher charges: For a strong ion with charge $|z_i|>1$, its $V_i$ moves proportionally slower relative to $V^\ominus_i$ as concentration increases!

For example, for a 10x ('decade') concentration increase at room temperature, the relative voltage's change $\frac{RT}{z_i F}\ln(10)$ is +59&nbsp;mV/decade for a 1+ ion, and would be -20&nbsp;mV/decade for a 3- ion.

## The $V^\ominus_i$ rigid ladder

We now have this $V^\ominus_i$, which unfortunately _cannot_ be tabulated since it is sensitive to arbitrary electrostatic offsets. We're not stuck though, as we can compare the relative $V^\ominus_i$ values of different ions. As we've seen, _differences_ in $V_i$'s are insensitive to the electrostatic offset, and that now includes $V^\ominus_i$'s too. So _differences_ in $V^\ominus_i$ are **electrically-invariant** properties of the solvent. And they are going to be **concentration-invariant** too (since they apply to the ideally dilute limit). Here are a number of selected $V^\ominus_i$ values for real water, all relative to each other of course:

(... ELD DIAGRAM GOES HERE ...)

Now let's see how I calculated those values from existing chemical literature.

When you look at a table of Gibbs energy of formation, the values for ions are _internal_: $\mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},i}$, which defines $\bar\mu^\ominus_i = \mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},i} + z_i F \phi$ according to whatever convention of $\phi$ was used for that solvent. Using this and $V^\ominus_i = \bar\mu^\ominus_i/(z_i F)$, we get (the $\phi$'s cancel):

$$V^\ominus_i - V^\ominus_j = \frac{\mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},i}}{z_i F} - \frac{\mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},j}}{z_j F}. $$

Thus we find for example that in water, $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V^\ominus_{\mathrm{Cl}^-} = -4.0746~\mathrm{V}$ -- this is the _extrapolated_ estimate of $V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$ that we would get if both sodium and chloride ions were present at each a concentration of 1 mol/L, if they behave ideally (and in reality, they don't). Going to a more dilute concentration of 0.001 mol/L, which is closer to the infinitely dilute ideal, then $\log_{10}(c/c^\ominus) = -3$, and $V_{\mathrm{Na}^+} - V_{\mathrm{Cl}^-} = -4.43~\mathrm{V}$.

In any case, we can tabulate all the $V^\ominus_i$ using any one of them as a common reference (let's use $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}$). Here I've taken some selected values from Atkins' _Physical Chemistry_ (8th edition, Table 2.7 in the back pages), and converted them. Note these are all for **ideally dilute ions in water** at 298 K and 1 bar, and they are for a reference ionic concentration of $c^\ominus = 1~\mathrm{mol/L}$.

(We also see on the $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} G^\ominus$ tables that $\mathrm{H}^+$ is often defined to have exactly 0 standard Gibbs energy of formation. This will have no effect on us as it's more related to defining $\phi$, which we will talk about in our later topic Potentials.)

## Relation to semiconductor bands

Conceptually, these standard state lines function much like conduction and valence band edges ($E_\mathrm{C}$, $E_\mathrm{V}$) do in semiconductor physics â€“ they act as reference energy/potential levels. The actual potential ($V_i$) deviates from the reference $V^\ominus_i$ based on the concentration, just as the Fermi level ($E_\mathrm{F}$) deviates from the band edges based on carrier concentration. Actually, as we have alluded to before, and we will talk about in much more depth in the Semiconductors topic, we can cram semiconductors into our electrochemical $V_i$ framework too! For silicon we find that $V^\ominus_\mathrm{h^+} - V^\ominus_\mathrm{e^-} = 1.27~\mathrm{V}$ (for a 1 mol/L reference concentration). I.e. the 'standard state ladder' for a semiconductor really only has two entries, one for conduction band electrons ($\mathrm{e^-}$), and the other for valence band holes ($\mathrm{h^+}$). The reason this 1.27 V value differs from the bandgap of silicon ($E_\mathrm{C} - E_\mathrm{V} = 1.1~\mathrm{eV}$) is simply that the band edges each correspond to less than a 1 mol/L concentration, so, $V^\ominus_\mathrm{h^+}$ sits slightly higher than $-E_\mathrm{V}/e$ and $V^\ominus_\mathrm{e^-}$ sits slightly lower than $-E_\mathrm{C}/e$.

## Example: common ion effect

Earlier in the Electrodes topic we talked about the silver / silver chloride electrode. Let's consider what happens when we add some potassium chloride salt to its solution:

{% include "esbd-diagrams/esbd-agcl-kcl-common-ion.html" %}

Here, under all conditions value of $V_\mathrm{Ag^+}$ is fixed to the electrode's $V_\mathrm{e^-}$, and in turn, this fixes $V_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ since the $\mathrm{AgCl}$ salt is saturating the solution.

Initially there are only $\mathrm{Ag^+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ ions, so by charge neutrality their concentrations have to be equal, and that means the standard states $V^\ominus_\mathrm{Ag^+}$, $V^\ominus_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ have to fit equidistant from $V_\mathrm{Ag^+}$ and $V_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ respectively. Thus we find $c_\mathrm{Ag^+} = c_\mathrm{Cl^-} = 1.3\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{mol/L}$.

When we add some $\mathrm{KCl}$ salt, we are increasing the $c_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ concentration, and thus $V^\ominus_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ has to move upwards. But if one part of the "ladder" moves, then all of the ladder moves. As a result, $V^\ominus_\mathrm{Ag^+}$ moves further from $V_\mathrm{Ag^+}$, decreasing its concentration $c_\mathrm{Ag^+}$.

This example also shows how the electrode potential, $E = V_\mathrm{e^-} - V^\ominus_\mathrm{H^+}$, is a function of the $c_\mathrm{Cl^-}$ concentration, and assuming the ideally dilute behaviour continues to $c_\mathrm{Cl^-} = c^\ominus = 1~\mathrm{mol/L}$, there we will find $E = 0.222~\mathrm{V}$.

## Takeaways

For the next topic, we'll talk about what happens where two solutions come into contact.

## Optional discussion

Chemists may be begging me to introduce activities and activity coefficients, and go beyond the ideally dilute limit. Fair enough! We'll get more into that in the later topic about non-ideal solutions, but let's talk a bit about that now:

</summary>

Yes, you are right, we can just tack on in the (molar) activity activity coefficient $\gamma_i$ next to $c_i/c^\ominus$!

$$ V_i = V^\ominus_i + \frac{RT}{z_i F} \ln(\gamma_i c_i/c^\ominus). $$

(Or, define activity $a_i = \gamma_i c_i/c^\ominus$, but let's just stick to $\gamma_i$.) 

Of course, $\gamma_i \rightarrow 1$ as all solutes' concentrations go to zero (including $c_i \rightarrow 0$). This is a perfectly legitimate mathematical re-representation of the electrochemical potentials into two numbers $V^\ominus_i$ and $\gamma_i$. Now we can pack all the imperfections into $\gamma_i$.

However...

You may have heard that single-ion activities are ill defined, or unmeasurable; or, that only mean ionic activity coefficients can be measured. That is the truth, and let's talk about why that is the case.

Suppose we have solution of specific composition, containing various ions and solutes, at known concentrations $c_i$, and certain measurable values of ionic $V_i$. We have somehow determined a collection of $\gamma_i$ values that correctly and consistently relate the various $V_i$ to their $V^{\ominus}_i$. All seems good, but our conclusion is non-unique.

The following transformation produces an equally valid collection of values $\gamma_i '$ and ${V^{\ominus}_i}'$:

$$ \gamma_i ' = \gamma_i \exp([z_i F / (RT)] \cdot \psi) , $$

$$ {V^{\ominus}_i}' = V^{\ominus}_i - \psi , $$

for any value of $\psi$. For example, with $\psi=-59~\mathrm{mV}$ we can lower the entire $V^{\ominus}_i$ ladder by 59 mV, and multiply $\gamma_i$ for 1+ ions by Ã—10, multiply $\gamma_i$ for 2- ions by Ã—0.01, and so on. If you are using electrostatic potential $\phi$, then $\phi' = \phi - \psi$ too. The problem is, we can't tell the difference, because all we can measure are $c_i$ and $V_i$.

The arbitrariness is _severe_: we can choose a different value of $\psi$ for every possible composition of solution at every temperature and every pressure, completely arbitrarily. It would make no measurable difference. **Once we permit the presence of activity coefficients, we no longer have _any_ anchor on how to set the electrostatic potential $\phi$ nor how we should offset the $V^{\ominus}_i$ ladder.**

The only unambiguously measureable ion activity coefficients are charge-neutral products like $\gamma_{\mathrm{Na}^+}\cdot\gamma_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$, or $\sqrt{\gamma_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}} \cdot \gamma_{\mathrm{Cl}^-}$ where the $\psi$ arbitrariness cancels out. These charge-neutral $\gamma_i$ products are the mean activity coefficients.

Anyway, that is one reason I'm just going to focus on ideal dilute case for now. There's a lot more to say on this, but I'll leave that for the dedicated topic on non-ideal solutions.
