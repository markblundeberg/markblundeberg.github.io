So far we've mostly avoided describing the connections to the various potentials found in standard electrochemistry, but let's state them now.

## The electrostatic potential $\phi$

The relationship between $\phi$ and our $V_i$ values comes about via a convention that $\mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{H}^+} = 0$ under all conditions. That is, if you look up the standard Gibbs formation energies of ions, you'll see $\mathrm{H}^+$ listed as 0 at all temperatures, and we've adopted the convention of setting chemical potentials based on Gibbs formation energies. Therefore, since $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} = \phi + \mu^\ominus_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{H}^+}/F$, this gives

$$ V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} = \phi.$$

In the below I'll just use $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ but you can sub in $\phi$.

## Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)

A generic hydrogen electrode interconverts hydrogen ions with hydrogen gas, $ \mathrm{H}^+ + \mathrm{e}^- \rightleftharpoons \tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{H}_2 $, which in terms of $V_i$ gives:

$$ V_{\mathrm{H}^+} - V_{\mathrm{e}^-} = \tfrac{1}{2F}\mu_{\mathrm{H}_2}. $$

The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is an aqueous system that has activity of $\mathrm{H}^+$ is 1 (i.e., pH of 0), which implies:

$$ V_{\mathrm{H}^+}(\text{SHE}) = V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} . $$

Moreover, the SHE is exposed to $\mathrm{H}_2$ gas at a fugacity (effective pressure) of 1 bar. If we are also at 25&nbsp;Â°C then this means the $\mathrm{H}_2$ is at the standard reference conditions for hydrogen, thus $\mu_{\mathrm{H}_2} = 0$. Technically for other temperatures, we are supposed to maintain a fugacity of 1 bar which means $\mu_{\mathrm{H}_2}$ varies from 0. As far as I can tell, the usual procedure is to simply set $\mu_{\mathrm{H}_2} = 0$.

Therefore, the SHE serves as a measuring point for $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ (which is also $\phi$ as we have seen above):

$$ V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{SHE}) = V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} = \phi .$$

Practically, it's not actually necessary to achieve these conditions (such as the extreme 0 pH), nor is it actually desirable to do so given the uncertainties about when unit $\mathrm{H}^+$ activity is exactly reached. To the contrary, the most precise measurements of $V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{SHE})$, as in e.g. a Harned cell, are actually extrapolated from more dilute solutions where the $\mathrm{H}^+$ activity is more predictably related to concentration (such as using the Debye-Huckel limiting law). In other words, any reference to $V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{SHE})$ is theoretical, and more concretely we can say we are actually referencing $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}$, or $\phi$.

## Reduction potentials

Generally, electrode potentials / reduction potentials are in principle voltmeter measurements referenced to the SHE as a baseline:

$$ E(\text{target}) = V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{target}) - V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{SHE}). $$

The preceding discussion showed us that $ V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{SHE}) $ is a proxy for $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} $. Thus, we have a local description of the reduction potential:

$$ E = V_{\mathrm{e}^-} - V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}. $$

(And sometimes this may be encountered as $E = -\tfrac{1}{F}\bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-} - \phi$.)

Since $V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ itself serves as a reference point for the $V^\ominus_{i}$ standard state ladder, this means the electrode potential describes the position of the standard state ladder in relation to the electron species voltage.

It is not even necessary for there to be an actual electrode present, such as with in-solution redox couples like $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$-$\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. Redox couples define an effective $V_{\mathrm{e}^-}$ and thus a reduction potential (usually called redox potential).

## Standard reduction potentials

Consider a metal electrode and its reduction reaction:

$$ \mathrm{M}^{n+} + n \mathrm{e}^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{M(s)}$$

Giving as usual our $V_i$ difference:

$$ V_{\mathrm{M}^{n+}} - V_{\mathrm{e}^-} = \frac{1}{nF} \mu_{\mathrm{M(s)}} .$$

The standard reduction potential $E^\ominus$ is the value of $E$ when the $M$ ions have unit activity ($V_{\mathrm{M}^{n+}} = V^\ominus_{\mathrm{M}^{n+}}$), thus we have:

$$ E^\ominus = V^\ominus_{\mathrm{M}^{n+}} - V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} - \frac{1}{nF} \mu_{\mathrm{M(s)}}.$$

And, assuming we are at standard conditions and so $\mathrm{M(s)}$ is a standard reference state (most stable allotrope) we have $\mu_{\mathrm{M(s)}} = 0$, and so our $V^\ominus_i$ ladder has exactly the structure of the reduction potentials, the only difference being that $V^\ominus_i$ can be shifted up and down together.

## pH

$$ \mathrm{pH} = -\log_{10}(a_{\mathrm{H}^+}) = -\log_{10}(e) \frac{F}{RT}(V_{\mathrm{H}^+} - V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+})$$

At 25 deg C:

$$ \mathrm{pH} = \frac{V^\ominus_{\mathrm{H}^+} - V_{\mathrm{H}^+}}{59~\mathrm{mV}}$$
