# Band Diagrams for Batteries? An Intuitive Visualization

Mark Lundeberg // 2025 April

{# **(Optional: Compelling Header Image/Animation showing a finished ESBD)** #}

Ever looked at a semiconductor device {%wiki "band diagram" %} and thought, "Wow, that makes intuitive sense!"? They clearly show electron and hole energy levels, band bending, equilibria, and driving forces. Band diagrams are the universal visual language of semiconductor devices.

Compare that to electrochemistry â€” trying to track electrode potentials, reference electrodes, solution potentials ($\phi$), ion chemical potentials ($\mu_i$), activities, junction potentials... it often feels like a confusing soup of concepts, right? What if we could bring some of that band diagram clarity to batteries, fuel cells, electrolysis, and more?

That's the idea behind **Electrochemical Species Band Diagrams (ESBDs)**. We are going back to basics, using fundamental thermodynamics to define a **species voltage $V_i$** and create a unified visual landscape that handles both electrons and ions. This site explores this framework, with the goal of building <em>intuition</em> for scientists and engineers working across disciplines involving charged species in materials.

This page gives a review of basic thermodynamics, and ends with a quick primer on the new $V_i$ idea. At the end, I'll link to further articles that apply this concept to electrochemistry. Let's dive in!

*(If you are already strongly familiar with chemical potential and electrochemical potential, feel free to [skip ahead](#skip_background)!)*

## Chemical potential: 'temperature' for particle flow

How do mobile particles know where to move and when to react? For any individual particle, this is a mess of microscopic forces. On average though, we can zoom out and talk about statistical tendencies of similar particles, and these tendencies are characterized by the {%wiki "chemical_potential" %} $\mu_i$ for the type/_species_ of particle labelled $i$. Chemical potentials are to particles what temperature $T$ is to energy: when two bodies are in equilibrium they equalize their $\mu_i$'s and $T$'s by exchanging the fungible particles and energy. The chemical potential combines all the per-particle energy, the entropy, the diffusion, the <em>mess</em> ... in just the right way.

The dimensions of $\mu_i$ are energy per particle (or for chemists, energy per mole), often units of electron-volts $\mathrm{eV}$ (or for chemists, $\mathrm{kJ/mol}$).
You may already know the chemical potential by another representation or name: Fugacity. Activity. Water potential. Fermi level. They all encode $\mu_i$.

Particles want to go from high $\mu_i$ to low $\mu_i$, as surely as energy wants to go from high $T$ to low $T$. You can think of it as 'particles want to roll downhill'! It's that easy, check out this interactive demo:

{% include "esbd-diagrams/mu-driving-force.html" %}

{# Note - we're assuming bodies with equal temperature for now! #}

## The electrochemical potential ($\bar{\mu}_i$)

There is also **{%wiki "electrochemical potential" %}**, denoted with a little bar on top: $\bar{\mu}_i$. To avoid some terminology ambiguities, when we talk about charged particles (electrons and ions) we will refer to their proper thermodynamic $\mu_i$ as the electrochemical potential $\bar{\mu}_i$. It works the same in many ways, like charged particles want to go from high $\bar{\mu}_i$ to low $\bar{\mu}_i$. But thermodynamics can get weird with charged particles, as the energy (and thus $\bar\mu_i$) of a charge is sensitive to the average electrostatic potential. So although $\bar\mu_i$ is perfectly well defined in theory, it is not simply dependent on the local material environment.

Unfortunately, when we keep material composition the same but simply change the electrostatic potential by $\Delta\phi$, each charged species' $\bar\mu_i$ is going to depend differently on electrostatic potential. Here $\Delta\phi$ could represent anything from a deliberate control variable to the arbitrary global offset in electrostatic potentials.

Here's an interactive visualization of how different particles' electrochemical potentials would vary solely due to a change $\Delta\phi$ in the electrostatic potential:

{% include "esbd-diagrams/mu-shift-only.html" %}

Here we've considered hypothetical charged species $\mathrm{A}^{2-}$, $\mathrm{B}^{-}$, $\mathrm{D}^{+}$, $\mathrm{E}^{2+}$, and a neutral species $\mathrm{C}$, all together in a thermodnamic body. The $\bar{\mu}_i$ levels move all over the place, seemingly at random! Actually, they're moving an amount $z_iF\Delta \phi$ per mole ($F$ is {%wiki "Faraday's constant" %} and $z_i$ is the ionic charge level, $-2$ or $+1$ etc.). If you prefer per-particle, that's $z_i e\Delta \phi$. 

Ionic systems always include at least one positive species and one negative species, and so these charge-dependent shifts in electrochemical potentials make it rather annoying to directly compare $\bar{\mu}_i$ values in different materials or conditions.

## How to tame your ion, the usual way

The traditional approach to deal with the charge-dependent shifts in electrochemical potential is to define an absolute material electrostatic potential $\phi$, and then subtract off each particle's electrostatic energy $z_i F \phi$ to arrive at a clean *internal* chemical potential, $\mu_{\mathrm{int},i} = \bar{\mu}_i - z_i F \phi$.

(Often $\mu_{\mathrm{int},i}$ is called "the chemical potential" and given symbol $\mu_i$, which can create ambiguity. To avoid confusion, I've adopted the unambiguous term "electrochemical potential" $\bar\mu_i$ for the proper, _total_ chemical potential of ions.)

Adapting the previous demo, you can see now that $\mu_{\mathrm{int},i}$ are unaffected by $\Delta\phi$:

{% include "esbd-diagrams/mu-shift-mu-internal.html" %}

This approach of partitioning off the $\phi$ dependence is quite helpful as $z_i F \phi$ seems simple and $\mu_{\mathrm{int},i}$ contains normal-ish chemistry. It does however mean that for electrochemical processes, it doubles the driving forces that we have to consider: an internal chemical component and an electrostatic component, which anyway sum to the measurable total driving force (from $\bar{\mu}_i$). And there is some difficulty with directly accessing $\phi$ in the lab. So this does complicate our mental picture too.

What if we could regularize the charge-dependent shifts in $\bar{\mu}_i$ some other way?

## <a name="skip_background"></a> We observe electrochemical potentials

Voltmeters are our primary instrument for measuring electrical phenomena. What do they _actually_ measure? What is "voltage" really?

The truth is that a voltmeter is a thermodynamic device: it lets a tiny number of electrons flow in, and it measures their potential for work, according to their electrochemical potential $\bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-}$. When you attach a voltmeter's probes to body 1 and body 2, the number you see on its display is $ \Delta V = -[\bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{body 2}) - \bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{body 1})]/F$, or if you prefer per-particle then $/e$. In other words, the 'absolute voltage' probed by a voltmeter is not electrostatic potential $\phi$ but instead something that depends on the electrochemical potential of electrons. Let's define our absolute voltage $V_{\mathrm{e}^-}$ as:

$$V_{\mathrm{e}^-} = \frac{\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}^-}}{-F}.$$

and so $ \Delta V = V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{body 2})- V_{\mathrm{e}^-}(\text{body 1})$. The voltmeter reads 0 when there is no driving force (equal $\bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-}$ and equal $V_{\mathrm{e}^-} $), easy! 

We cannot make $\phi$ work so easily as we have in general $\Delta V \neq \phi(\text{body 2}) - \phi(\text{body 1})$ unless the two bodies are identical materials. Rather than bloat this $\phi$ formula with corrections involving $\mu_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{e}^-}$, it is far more elegant to say that our everyday ordinary voltage is simply $V_{\mathrm{e}^-}$. For semiconductor device engineers, this notion of giving primacy to $\bar\mu_{\mathrm{e}^-}$ (Fermi level) is crucial for grokking semiconductor band diagrams, that relate internals of semiconductor devices to external voltages.

But why privilege electrons? Yes, everyday voltmeters are electron-only. But let's at least mathematically try to treat ions on equal footing with electrons.

## Meet $V_i$: a voltage for ions, too

Let's define a **species voltage, $V_i$**, for _any_ charged species $i$:

$$V_i = \frac{\bar{\mu}_i}{z_i F}$$

This is the big idea. We just divide the energy per mole by the charge per mole (for per-particle that's $V_i = \bar{\mu}_i / (z_i e)$). That seems simple, maybe _too_ simple? Stick around, because this scaling has a profound consequence on the way that we can visualize electrochemistry.

Let's try shifting that electrostatic offset one final time, for those variously charged species:

{% include "esbd-diagrams/mu-V-unison-shift.html" %}

_Aha_! The $V_i$ levels for all charged species **shift together** by the exact same amount ($\Delta V_i = \Delta \phi$)! It's no longer as messy, although, we haven't fully gotten rid of the effect of $\Delta \phi$? Also there is no $V_{\rm C}$ for our uncharged $C$ species. That's all okay, we actually want it that way.

(Readers who know semiconductor band diagrams might recognize this shifting-together property. It is a fundamental trait of band diagrams that makes them work.)

Remember before when we talked about particles going downhill in $\bar\mu$? Welcome to the the $V_i$ world, it's a little different but you'll get used to it:

- **Cations ($z > 0$)** want to move from **high $V_+$ to low $V_+$**. (They "fall down" their $V_i$ landscape).
- **Anions ($z < 0$)** want to move from **low $V_-$ to high $V_-$**. (They "float up" their $V_i$ landscape).
- If the $V_i$ for a given species is flat, then that species is in equilibrium and there is no driving force.

That might sound familiar too, it's just the thermodynamic version of positive charges in a vacuum getting pushed from high $\phi$ to low $\phi$, or vice versa for negative charges! The big difference is, now each species of particle experiences a different voltage landscape $V_i$. That's because $V_i$ includes some chemical energy, which will differ from species to species.

## Introducing the Diagram: $V_i$ vs $x$

Okay, so $V_i$ gives us a consistent way to view potentials that shift uniformly. But devices have different materials and potentials change with _position_, $x$. We need to plot $V_i$ vs. $x$!

This leads us to the **Electrochemical Species Band Diagram (ESBD)**. Here's a first look at one for a textbook system (don't worry about understanding every line just yet!):

{% include "esbd-diagrams/esbd-concentration-cell-agno3.html" %}

This is a silver nitrate {%wiki "concentration cell" %}: two solutions with differing concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{AgNO}_3$, connected to each other by an ionic junction.A measurable voltage ($V_{\mathrm{e}^-}$ difference) develops in two silver metal electrodes that are dipped in the solutions.

You can see different lines representing the $V_i$ for different species ($V_{e^-}$, $V_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}$, $V_{\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}}$) across different regions (electrodes, electrolytes). Features like the standard state potentials ($V^\circ$) or interface reaction markers ($\rightleftharpoons$) provide more context, which we'll explore later. The key idea is visualizing the potential landscape for _all_ relevant charged species vs. position.

It's just like a band diagram!

- $V_i$ are like Fermi levels.
- The standard states $V^\circ_i$ are like the band edges, rigidly keeping space with each other by a constant 'bandgap'.
- All the relative levels are invariant to global shifts in electrostatic potential (the shifting-together property), and the y-axis offset has no meaning.

To the semiconductor people: It's not just an analogy; if we applied this method to a semiconductor device, our diagram would be _exactly_ a band diagram... only upside down. To make it a bit more comfortable, I've added an 'eV' button that plots "electronic energy" $E_i = -e V_i$, flipping it to what we're used to and making $E_{\mathrm{e}^-} = \text{Fermi level}$. But I have come to believe the $V_i$ form is the more natural form when we want to include ionics, and it just takes getting used to. We'll explore the connection to classic band diagrams in a later topic below.

To the electrochemists: if you find $V_i$ and these diagrams strange, just remember we can connect it back: $V_i = \phi + \tfrac{1}{z_i F}\mu_{\mathrm{int},i} = \phi + \tfrac{1}{z_i F} \mu^\circ_i + \tfrac{RT}{z_i F} \ln a_i$. In general I'm going to avoid plotting $\phi$ and prioritize discussions of $V_i$. We'll get back to that more in a later topic where we discuss how the usual electrochemical potentials (electrode, junction, redox, etc.) are precisely connected to $V_i$.
