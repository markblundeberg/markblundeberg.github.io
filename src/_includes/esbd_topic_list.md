Basics:
- [_Electrodes_](/esbd/electrodes/) - Electron-ion interfaces.
- [_Lithium ion batteries_](/esbd/lib/) - An application spotlight.
- [_Solutions_](/esbd/solutions/) - Concentrations, standard states $V^\circ$.
- [_Junctions_](/esbd/junctions/) - Salt bridges and ion membranes.

Advanced:
- [_Potentials_](/esbd/potentials/) - How the usual potentials of electrochemistry relate to $V_i$.
- _Semiconductors_ - Electrons and holes, and classic band diagrams. {# comes after solutions so we can talk in detail about electron and hole standard states vs band edges. #}
- _Corrosion_ - Local inhomogeneities
- _General electrodes_ - Gas, redox, multi-ion
- [_Non-ideal solutions_](/esbd/nonideal) - Focussing on technical difficulties of single-ion activities.
- [_Non-equilibrium_](/esbd/nonequilibrium/) - Overpotentials

Appendices:

- [_Thermodynamics_](/esbd/thermodynamics) - Subtleties of the basic thermodynamics of charged systems.
- [_Nuances_](/esbd/nuances/) - Are $V_i$ "real voltages"?
- [_The case against $\phi$_](/esbd/phi/) - Why we should bypass using an electrostatic potential.
- [_About_](/esbd/about/) - How this project came about.
