*The $V_i$ landscape*:

- [$V_i$](/esbd/v_i/) - the fundamentals
- [_Equilibrium_](/esbd/equilibrium/) - electrodes and reactions.
- [_Lithium ion batteries_](/esbd/lib/) - An application spotlight.
- [_Driving forces_](/esbd/drive/) - Transport and reactions out of equilibrium.

*Materials*:

- [_Solutions_](/esbd/solutions/) - Concentrations, activities, standard states $V^\circ_i$.
- [_Solid state_](/esbd/solidstate/) - The close connection between $V^\circ_i$ and band edges; holes as ions.

*Single-solution chemistry*:
- Charge neutrality.
- Solubility products.
- [_Potentials_](/esbd/potentials/) - Redox potentials in terms of $V_i$.
- [_pH_](/esbd/ph/) - The standard measure of acidity, in terms of $V_i$.

*Spatial variations*:
- [_Transport_](/esbd/transport2/) - Steady state transport & concentration gradients. (esp. two-ion)
- [_Junctions_](/esbd/junctions/) - Salt bridges and ion membranes.
- Band bending (semiconductor / Debye layer)

*Application highlights*:
- Lead-Acid Batteries: A system where the electrolyte is a reactant.
- Water Electrolysis & Fuel Cells: Highlighting the role of catalysis and pH.
- Electroplating: A kinetic-driven process.
- Corrosion: A mixed-potential, non-equilibrium system.
