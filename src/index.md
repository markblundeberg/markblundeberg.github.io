Welcome to my site!

I'm Mark Lundeberg, a former physicist. I used to study graphene, but even after I left academia I've maintained a fascination with thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

There's only one thing on the site now, which is my exploration of making band diagrams work for electrochemistry.
